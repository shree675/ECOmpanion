      "Conventional faucets flow at around 5 gallons per minute, and say you brush for 5 minutes a day. Taking out the time you keep the tap closed(3min) generally, you use around 10 gallons, i.e about 38 litres a day just for brushing ! But in reality, less than a minute of running water is required while brushing ….that means an average person wastes about 5 gallons and that is about 19 litres of water ! And as a matter of fact, a family of four that “water watches” when brushing and washing can save a minimum of 15,600 gallons (59,052 liters) a year. And all of that goes into the drain !",

    "A 6kg average domestic wash has the potential to release as many as 700,000 fibres into the environment. This means, everyday, you add more than thousands of microfibres to the oceans that could end up on your plate of seafood one day.",
    "longDescription": [
      "An alarming number of tiny fibers from synthetic fabrics are making their way from your washing machine into aquatic animals everyday, which should make you think twice before you pop stuff in the laundry you’ve only worn once.",
      "These plastic fibers have the potential to bioaccumulate, concentrating toxins in the bodies of larger animals, higher up the food chain (eventually often humans).\nNumerous studies already show that microfibres are present in concerning quantities, in fish and other seafood available in the market.\n(Studies also show that: Microfiber masses from top-load machines were approximately 7 times those from front-load machines.)",
      "What can you do about it?\n\t1. Wash synthetic clothes less frequently and for a shorter duration.\n\t2.Fill up your washing machine. Washing a full load results in less friction between the clothes and fewer fibers released.\n\t3.Consider switching to a liquid laundry soap. Laundry powder “scrubs” and loosens more microfibers.\n\t4.Use a colder wash setting, it uses less energy. Higher temperature can damage clothes and release more fibers.\n\t5.Dry spin clothes at low revs. Higher revolutions increase the friction between the clothes.\n\t6.Turn clothes inside out while washing. It will also increase wearability.\n\t7.Buy clothes made from natural fibers such as cotton, linen, and wool. Natural fibers will eventually break down in the environment. Plastic fibers will never go away."

They leach hazardous amounts of lead in landfills-- on average, more than 17 times the threshold for what constitutes hazardous waste.",

Telecommunications networks and data centres consume a lot of energy to serve you and most data centres continue to be powered by electricity generated by fossil fuels. It’s the energy consumption we don’t see.For every text message, for every phone call, every video you upload or download, there’s a data centre making this happen",

      "What you should do:\n\t1.Check brands for transparency in their supply chain and sustainable design - which means recycled materials, durability and easy and inexpensive to repair.\n\t2.Consider the possibility of buying a second-hand or refurbished phone.\n\t3.DO NOT buy a new phone unless you need to. The newest phone with the newest features comes out every alternate week, but chances are, you can do without it for a few more years\n\t4.When you no longer have use of an old phone, dispose of it responsibly.Almost 80% of your phone is recyclable.

Every purchase you make from a sustainably responsible brand, your contribution shifts the balance a little bit closer to a circular and sustainable fashion economy",

    "Most large beauty brands are using chemical components in their products, whether they claim to be natural or not. This is because chemicals give the products their long shelf life and allow for the various textures and feels you find in traditional cosmetics. The challenge with these chemical components is that they don’t break down and instead accumulate in our ecosystems. Traditional cosmetics and toiletries do the most damage to the environment once they are washed away down our sinks and damage the ecosystem.",
    "longDescription": [
      "The packaging that envelops perfumes, serums and moisturisers contributes to the loss of 18 million acres of forest each year. If this level of consumption continues, by 2050 there will be 12 billion tonnes of plastic in landfills, the equivalent to 35,000 Empire State Buildings. The UN has declared our current situation a ‘planetary crisis’ and no industry is exempt from scrutiny, including beauty.",
      "What can you do?\nFancy packaging is unnecessary and often only a marketing ploy to make us view a product as more luxurious and elite. Did you know that lipstick cases are weighed down so that they feel expensive but become un-recyclable? As consumers, it is our duty to seek out brands and packaging that doesn’t follow this trend. We must also become steadfast recyclers and re-users of packaging.\nAnother way that we can mitigate the environmental impact of the cosmetics we use is to buy from smaller suppliers.  The benefit of buying 100% natural products from a smaller company means that the ingredients are more likely sourced sustainably which means shorter supply chains and a smaller carbon footprint.",

      "But unfortunately, even mountains are under threat from climate change and overexploitation. As the global climate continues to warm, mountain people — some of the world’s poorest — face even greater struggles to survive. The rising temperatures also mean that mountain glaciers are melting at unprecedented rates, affecting freshwater supplies downstream for millions of people.",
      "The increasing attention to the importance of mountains led the UN to declare to 2002 the UN International Year of Mountains. ",
      "It has been observed every year to create awareness about the importance of mountains to life, to highlight the opportunities and constraints in mountain development and to build alliances that will bring positive change to mountain peoples and environments around the world.."

    "longDescription": [
      "An alarming number of tiny fibers from synthetic fabrics are making their way from your washing machine into aquatic animals everyday, which should make you think twice before you pop stuff in the laundry you’ve only worn once.",
      "These plastic fibers have the potential to bioaccumulate, concentrating toxins in the bodies of larger animals, higher up the food chain (eventually often humans).\nNumerous studies already show that microfibres are present in concerning quantities, in fish and other seafood available in the market.\n(Studies also show that: Microfiber masses from top-load machines were approximately 7 times those from front-load machines.)",
      "What can you do about it?\n\t1. Wash synthetic clothes less frequently and for a shorter duration.\n\t2.Fill up your washing machine. Washing a full load results in less friction between the clothes and fewer fibers released.\n\t3.Consider switching to a liquid laundry soap. Laundry powder “scrubs” and loosens more microfibers.\n\t4.Use a colder wash setting, it uses less energy. Higher temperature can damage clothes and release more fibers.\n\t5.Dry spin clothes at low revs. Higher revolutions increase the friction between the clothes.\n\t6.Turn clothes inside out while washing. It will also increase wearability.\n\t7.Buy clothes made from natural fibers such as cotton, linen, and wool. Natural fibers will eventually break down in the environment. Plastic fibers will never go away."

They leach hazardous amounts of lead in landfills-- on average, more than 17 times the threshold for what constitutes hazardous waste.",

Telecommunications networks and data centres consume a lot of energy to serve you and most data centres continue to be powered by electricity generated by fossil fuels. It’s the energy consumption we don’t see.For every text message, for every phone call, every video you upload or download, there’s a data centre making this happen",

The newest phone with the newest features comes out every alternate week, but chances are, you can do without it for a few more years\n\t4.When you no longer have use of an old phone, dispose of it responsibly.Almost 80% of your phone is recyclable.

    "Fast fashion can be defined as cheap, trendy clothing that uses rapid production, and low quality materials in order to bring inexpensive styles to the public. Much of today’s production is designed neither for longevity nor recycling, but rather for short life cycles to encourage consumers to buy anew.",
    "longDescription": [
      "How your clothing habits make the difference between life and death for some…\n\nBy 2050, the global fashion industry could use more than a quarter of the global carbon budget associated with a 2℃ temperature rise.That means the Arctic will have ice-free summers and disastrous wildfires that are notorious for heating up the arctic even more at an uncontrollable pace. If you don’t do your bit to shift the cycle of the fashion industry, you will be one of the reasons that numerous adorable polar bear cubs and other precious wildlife will die in the fires or of starvation, if they’re not extinct in the wild already.",
      "Apart from the inevitable environmental impacts, you should also know that brands are able to earn millions while selling pieces cheaply because of the sheer number of items they sell daily, no matter the cost or markup. This means that garment workers putting together fast fashion items are undoubtedly being paid well below the minimum wage. “Fast fashion isn’t free. Someone, somewhere is paying.”\n— LUCY SIEGLE",
      "What can you do?\nStop. Stop mindlessly buying clothes unless you really really really need them. When you absolutely must buy something, embrace the idea of slow fashion. Slow fashion is a movement towards mindful manufacturing, fair labor rights, natural materials, and lasting garments. Every purchase you make from a sustainably responsible brand, your contribution shifts the balance a little bit closer to a circular and sustainable fashion economy",

    "Most large beauty brands are using chemical components in their products, whether they claim to be natural or not. This is because chemicals give the products their long shelf life and allow for the various textures and feels you find in traditional cosmetics. The challenge with these chemical components is that they don’t break down and instead accumulate in our ecosystems. Traditional cosmetics and toiletries do the most damage to the environment once they are washed away down our sinks and damage the ecosystem.",
    "longDescription": [
      "The packaging that envelops perfumes, serums and moisturisers contributes to the loss of 18 million acres of forest each year. If this level of consumption continues, by 2050 there will be 12 billion tonnes of plastic in landfills, the equivalent to 35,000 Empire State Buildings. The UN has declared our current situation a ‘planetary crisis’ and no industry is exempt from scrutiny, including beauty.",
      "What can you do?\nFancy packaging is unnecessary and often only a marketing ploy to make us view a product as more luxurious and elite. Did you know that lipstick cases are weighed down so that they feel expensive but become un-recyclable? As consumers, it is our duty to seek out brands and packaging that doesn’t follow this trend. We must also become steadfast recyclers and re-users of packaging.\nAnother way that we can mitigate the environmental impact of the cosmetics we use is to buy from smaller suppliers.  The benefit of buying 100% natural products from a smaller company means that the ingredients are more likely sourced sustainably which means shorter supply chains and a smaller carbon footprint.",

But practicing self control and focusing on what you are eating allows you to reflect on where your food has come from and how it is nourishing your body. “If you tune in to your hunger signals you may learn that you don’t need as much food as you thought, and resize your meals accordingly,” says Makwana from Toast & Tonic. Staying mindful about the source of your raw material is always important too. Himalayan water is untouched and unprocessed water from the Himalayas, enriched with natural minerals that makes it perfect for your health and for long term benefits to your body. \",\"Another key to zero waste cooking is keeping ingredients from going bad — if you aren’t able to cook them in time, focus on preservation.For example…freezing ingredients stops the ripening process in its tracks. You can freeze fruits and vegetables to use at a future time; to store prepared foods for later; or use the freezing process to “cook” them for now the dehydrator PROPERLY PICKLE .You can’t pour piping hot pickling liquid over everything, but if handled the right way Cooking fruit or vegetables down into jam can be another good way to preserve items that are at their peak, before they head into the trash zone",
      "While reducing food waste can be challenging, food waste is a huge problem and there are things you can do. One great initiative exists in Maastricht, where edible food waste is distributed in the community by volunteers free of charge. Of course it would be even better to avoid food waste before it even occurs. At events, the most effective way of directly preventing food waste is to prepare food onsite. The problem is that this often includes high staff costs and expensive mobile kitchens. This can be mitigated through volunteers who are willing to prepare the food free of charge.",

      "World Rhino Day is observed on September 22 every year to raise awareness and build a safe natural habitat for this incredible species.",
      "The rhinoceros is Africa’s armoured giant – like a tank on legs – and has been on our planet for millions of years. But right now they need our help. Poaching of rhinos for their horns and habitat loss are huge threats to both white and black rhinos.",
      "Sadly there are no ‘northern’ white rhinos left in the wild, and only a handful in captivity. But the ‘southern’ white rhino is a conservation success story – it’s been helped back from under 100 in 1895 to over 20,000 in the wild today.",
      "But poaching of rhinos for rhino horn is still a huge threat, and the poachers have got increasingly better equipped. Help us make sure we don’t lose these incredibly precious creatures."

      "An alarming number of tiny fibers from synthetic fabrics are making their way from your washing machine into aquatic animals everyday, which should make you think twice before you pop stuff in the laundry you’ve only worn once.",

      "What can you do about it?\n\t1. Wash synthetic clothes less frequently and for a shorter duration.\n\t2.Fill up your washing machine. Washing a full load results in less friction between the clothes and fewer fibers released.\n\t3.Consider switching to a liquid laundry soap. Laundry powder “scrubs” and loosens more microfibers.\n\t4.Use a colder wash setting, it uses less energy. Higher temperature can damage clothes and release more fibers.\n\t5.Dry spin clothes at low revs. Higher revolutions increase the friction between the clothes.\n\t6.Turn clothes inside out while washing. It will also increase wearability.\n\t7.Buy clothes made from natural fibers such as cotton, linen, and wool. Natural fibers will eventually break down in the environment. Plastic fibers will never go away."

      "What can you do?\nStop. Stop mindlessly buying clothes unless you really really really need them. When you absolutely must buy something, embrace the idea of slow fashion. Slow fashion is a movement towards mindful manufacturing, fair labor rights, natural materials, and lasting garments. Every purchase you make from a sustainably responsible brand, your contribution shifts the balance a little bit closer to a circular and sustainable fashion economy",

    "Most large beauty brands are using chemical components in their products, whether they claim to be natural or not. This is because chemicals give the products their long shelf life and allow for the various textures and feels you find in traditional cosmetics. The challenge with these chemical components is that they don’t break down and instead accumulate in our ecosystems. Traditional cosmetics and toiletries do the most damage to the environment once they are washed away down our sinks and damage the ecosystem.",
    "longDescription": [
      "The packaging that envelops perfumes, serums and moisturisers contributes to the loss of 18 million acres of forest each year. If this level of consumption continues, by 2050 there will be 12 billion tonnes of plastic in landfills, the equivalent to 35,000 Empire State Buildings. The UN has declared our current situation a ‘planetary crisis’ and no industry is exempt from scrutiny, including beauty.",
      "What can you do?\nFancy packaging is unnecessary and often only a marketing ploy to make us view a product as more luxurious and elite. Did you know that lipstick cases are weighed down so that they feel expensive but become un-recyclable? As consumers, it is our duty to seek out brands and packaging that doesn’t follow this trend. We must also become steadfast recyclers and re-users of packaging.\nAnother way that we can mitigate the environmental impact of the cosmetics we use is to buy from smaller suppliers.  The benefit of buying 100% natural products from a smaller company means that the ingredients are more likely sourced sustainably which means shorter supply chains and a smaller carbon footprint.",
