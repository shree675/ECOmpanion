      "How your clothing habits make the difference between life and death for some…\n\nBy 2050, the global fashion industry could use more than a quarter of the global carbon budget associated with a 2℃ temperature rise.That means the Arctic will have ice-free summers and disastrous wildfires that are notorious for heating up the arctic even more at an uncontrollable pace. If you don’t do your bit to shift the cycle of the fashion industry, you will be one of the reasons that numerous adorable polar bear cubs and other precious wildlife will die in the fires or of starvation, if they’re not extinct in the wild already.\n\nApart from the inevitable environmental impacts, you should also know that brands are able to earn millions while selling pieces cheaply because of the sheer number of items they sell daily, no matter the cost or markup. This means that garment workers putting together fast fashion items are undoubtedly being paid well below the minimum wage. “Fast fashion isn’t free. Someone, somewhere is paying.”\n\n— LUCY SIEGLE\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nStop. Stop mindlessly buying clothes unless you really really really need them. When you absolutely must buy something, embrace the idea of slow fashion. Slow fashion is a movement towards mindful manufacturing, fair labor rights, natural materials, and lasting garments. Every purchase you make from a sustainably responsible brand, your contribution shifts the balance a little bit closer to a circular and sustainable fashion economy"
